# Continuous Integration Overview

## Problem

- team of developers doing frequent merges cause following difficulties:
    1. What if codes don't compile after merge?
    2. What if someone breaks something?
    3. It would be a lot of work to check these things every merge

## Solution

- automate it!

## Continuous Integration

- `Continuous Integration` is the practice of frequently merging code changes
- `Continuous Integration` is centered around automation 

## Continuous Integration - How it Works

- `Continous Integration` server executes a build that automatically prepares / compiles the code and runs automated tests
- `Continuous Integration` server automatically detects changes in code in source control

## Jenkins

- `Jenkins` is a CI solution
