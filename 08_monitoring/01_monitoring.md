# Monitoring

- `Monitoring` is collecting and presenting data about the performance and stability of applications and infrastructure.

- `Monitoring` is ciritical because you need to be able to
    1. identify problem
    2. quickyl fix problem


## Types of Monitoring

1. Infrastructure Monitoring
    - `Infrastructure Monitoring` Collects data about the health, performance, and capacity needs of infrastructure: 
        1. CPU Load, 
        2. Memory Usage, 
        3. Disk Usage
    - `Infrastructure Monitoring` lets us know
        1. How our infrastructure is doing
        2. Whether we need to upgrade the infrastructure
2. Application Performance Monitoring
    - `Application Monitoring` collects data about the health and performance of the apps themselves
    - `Application Monitoring` includes:
        1. Requests per minute
        2. Error Rate
        3. Average Response Time

- `Infrastructure Monitoring` and `Application Monitoring` are both important to have overall understanding about the health of entire infrastructure


## Ways of presenting and Using the Data

- Two major ways
    1. `Aggregation`
        - Means displaying the data in the form of graphs and dashboards designed to provide actionable information
    2. `Alerting`
        - Pushing notifications to people about important events in real time

## Monitoring Tools

- There are two major monitoring tools:
    1. `Prometheus`
    2. `Grafana`
